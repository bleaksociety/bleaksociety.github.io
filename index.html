  <blockquote>"The more often we see the things around us &#45; even the beautiful and wonderful things &#45; the more they become invisible to us. That is why we often take for granted the beauty of this world: the flowers, the trees, the birds, the clouds &#45; even those we love. Because we see things so often, we see them less and less."
